# Data-Compressor

## How to Use It
To use this program, you would need to have the zlib library installed and linked to your executable. For example, if you were using the g++ compiler on a Linux system, you could compile the program like this:

* g++ -o compress compress.cpp -lz


This would create an executable called compress that you could run like this:

* ./compress input_file

Where input_file is the path to the file you want to compress. The program would then print out the compression metrics.
